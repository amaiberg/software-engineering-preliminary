\chapter{Getting Ready for a Biomedical Question Answering System}

In this task, you won't need to write any code (except that you need to edit
your Wiki page in Github flavored markdown language), instead you will learn a
new biomedical question answering task. Plus, we will also mention how to create
Milestones and Issues in the GitHub ISSUES system. 

%Finally, you will create your
%own question answering system based on an archetype framework called
%\texttt{hellobioqa} we built for you.
