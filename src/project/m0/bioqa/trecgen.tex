Question Answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of
information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP) which is concerned
with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a
natural
language.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering}} The
system you are going to build will handle biomedical questions (e.g. ``Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women?''). As you can see, different from a general question answering, a biomedical QA system requires domain specific knowledge bases, NLP tools, literature collections, etc., in order to produce meaningful answers.

One of the biomedical information retrieval challenges is the BioASQ task\footnote{\url{http://www.bioasq.org/}}. BioASQ provides a platform for testing and experiments of retrieval methods for different tasks. Specifically, you will be focusing on Task 2b of the BioASQ challenge on the retrieval of ``relevant concepts (from designated terminologies and ontologies), relevant articles (in English, from designated article repositories), relevant snippets (from the relevant articles), relevant RDF triples (from designated ontologies), exact answers (e.g., named entities in the case of factoid questions) and 'ideal' answers (paragraph-sized summaries), both in English on retrieval of relevant passages within an article collection from biomedical journals as answers to the questions in biomedical domain\footnote{From BioASQ task description}''.

BioASQ provides 29 annotated sample questions created by domain experts in biology. There are four types of questions: factoid, yes/no, list questions (provide one or more answers), summary questions. All of the questions are listed
in Table \ref{tab:question}:

Concepts, documents, and triples will be wrapped in services described in Milestone 1. Snippet retrieval will be described in Milestone 2. Finally, exact answer generation will be described in Milestone 3.
