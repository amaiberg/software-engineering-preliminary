\chapter{Completing your BioASQ pipeline}
\vspace{-1cm}
In this task you will implement components to retrieve exact answers for a biomedical question answering pipeline (based on BioASQ's Task1b Phase A). We advise you to focus on either yes/no, factoid, or list questions. For those who are still interested in summary questions, please contact the TAs. You will create your own pipeline based on a provided archetype framework from M1. Note: the \textbf{only requirement} is that you use the typesystem provided in the archetype. You are otherwise permitted and encouraged to use any additional types and source code you may wish.

The final milestone will be done in the spirit of a friendly competition. The team with the best and/or most creative pipelines will be given a yet-to-be-specified award. Note, representatives from Roche Pharmaceuticals will also review the results of the most promising teams. For those who have done well in this task and are interested in internship/research opportunities in the biomedical domain, please contact Avner Maiberg or Zi Yang (\href{mailto:ziy@cs.cmu.edu}{\nolinkurl{ziy@cs.cmu.edu}}).
