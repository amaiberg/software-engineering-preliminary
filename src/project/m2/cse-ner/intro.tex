\chapter{Migrating from UIMA SDK to CSE Framework}

In this task (for Milestone 1), you won't need to write too much code (some
changes to your existing annotators may be necessary), instead you will be
guided to migrate from UIMA SDK to CSE Framework by putting all the named entity
recognizers you team members implemented in Homework 1 into the new
\texttt{hellobioqa} project and listing all of them as options.
