\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Submission:} 
Use the same process as for previous assignments (set up GitHub repo, create a Maven 
project, write your code, submit to Maven repo), except that the name has changed to:
hw3-ID

\item \textbf{Write a design report:}
We expect you to document how you designed the execution and
deployment architecture for the sample information system. 
We will extract your documents from your
submitted jar files. 
Remember to include your ID as part of the report file name, and put your name and
ID inside your document. Please submit in PDF format only.
The report should be put in the folder \textbf{src/main/resources/docs}.

%One very special descriptor is the \verb|CpeDescriptor.xml|, which is the entry
%point for the entire pipeline. You are required to name your CPE descriptor
%exactly the same way, and place it in the right place for us to evaluate your
%code.

\item \textbf{Javadocs:} 
Please remember to give an appropriate description (Javadoc comments) for each 
piece of code you create and/or modify.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Useful information}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We encourage you to start Homework 3 as early as possible.

\item 
We expect that most of the general communication between the instructor team and students will take place on 
\href{https://piazza.com/class/hyvsubeilei6dd}{Piazza}.
For private questions, e.g., regarding grades, you may contact instructors by e-mail.
Your friendly TAs are:

\item Parag Argawal (\href{mailto:paraga@andrew.cmu.edu}{\nolinkurl{paraga@andrew.cmu.edu}}) 
\item Leonid (Leo) Boytsov (\href{mailto:srchvrs@cmu.edu}{\nolinkurl{srchvrs@cmu.edu}})
\item Xuezi (Manfred) Zhang (\href{mailto:xueziz@andrew.cmu.edu}{\nolinkurl{xueziz@andrew.cmu.edu}}) 
\end{itemize}

\item Source files and pdf file of this assignment are publicly available on 
the  \href{http://github.com/amaiberg/software-engineering-preliminary}{GitHub page}.
Please feel free to fork the project and modify if necessary.
Should you notice any error, feel free to fix it and create/send a pull request (as some
of you did for previous frameworks).

\section*{Getting started: Creating Maven project from the archetype}
For this task, we have prepared another archetype to help you quickly build your project. 
The tutorial for Homework 1 might help you create a Maven project from an archetype.
For this Homework, you need to add the following Catalog URL
